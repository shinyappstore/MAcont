# MAcont: Harness Meta-Analysis Data of Continuous Outcomes

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/MAcont](https://shinyappstore.com/a/MAcont)__

MAcont is an accessible yet sophisticated application designed to bring commonly used and advanced meta-analytic approaches within reach of users without programming skills but possessing a good understanding of meta-analytic concepts. Featuring an in-built example dataset, MAcont showcases its functionalities using default data, while users can seamlessly upload their datasets for subsequent analysis and manipulation. The application provides five approaches for estimating the summary mean difference, encompassing standard aggregate data methods, ANCOVA recovered effect estimates, and one-stage and two-stage pseudo IPD ANCOVA. Users can choose between random-effects (RE) or common (fixed)-effect (CE) models for the AD analytic methods, with the RE models estimating between-study heterogeneity using the restricted maximum likelihood approach.
